Team Spirit Poster

Concept: This poster highlights our team CCIS PHANTOMS, placing the mascot in the center with pink and white colors. The gradient background and glowing effects give it a lively, dynamic look.

Theme: “Shadows of Greatness” represents our team values: silent strength and unstoppable spirit. Pink shows energy, white shows teamwork. The poster inspires positive team spirit for BSCS-4.
